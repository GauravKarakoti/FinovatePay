# FinovatePay Architecture

## Overview
FinovatePay is a hybrid payment rail for B2B payments that combines off-chain UX with on-chain settlement, escrow, and compliance.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend**: React application with wallet integration
2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with Socket.IO for real-time updates
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing application data
4. **Blockchain**: Ethereum L2 (Polygon) for smart contracts
5. **Storage**: IPFS/S3 for document storage

### Smart Contracts
1. **InvoiceRegistry**: Records invoice hashes and metadata on-chain
2. **EscrowContract**: Handles payment escrow and dispute resolution
3. **ComplianceManager**: Manages KYC status and account freezing
4. **FractionToken**: ERC-1155 for tokenizing invoices (optional v2)

### Data Flow
1. Seller creates invoice → stored in DB with hash recorded on-chain
2. Buyer pays invoice → funds locked in escrow contract
3. Both parties confirm → escrow releases funds to seller
4. Dispute raised → multisig/arbitrator resolves with evidence
5. Invoice financing → investors buy fractional tokens representing invoice value

### Security Considerations
- KYC/AML mandatory for all financial operations
- Multisig and timelocks for admin actions
- Sensitive documents stored off-chain, only hashes on-chain
- Regular smart contract audits

### Compliance Features
- Integration with third-party KYC providers
- Wallet address mapping to compliance status
- Admin ability to freeze suspicious accounts
- All actions produce auditable on-chain receipts

### Monetization
- Transaction fees (0.1-0.5%)
- Subscription for marketplaces
- Spread on invoice financing
- Premium compliance services

## Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Backend: AWS/Azure/Google Cloud
- Database: Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- Blockchain: Polygon/Mumbai testnet initially, then mainnet
- Storage: IPFS cluster or S3-compatible storage
